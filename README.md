# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a simple Etch-a-Sketch web application demonstrating basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to:
- Set up a GitHub repository and use Git for version control.
- Create an HTML structure for a web page.
- Style the web page using CSS.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the DOM.

## Features
- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- Hover effect to change the color of grid squares.
- Button to reset the grid size.
- Extra credit: Random colors and progressive darkening effect.
